# delta-calibration
Automatic delta 3d printer calibration with interface to http://www.escher3d.com/pages/wizards/wizarddelta.php

Two pars of application, chrome extension to interact with calibration page and chrome app to interact with printer over serial port.

For now only repetier is supported.

When google will stop supporting chrome apps backend should be rewritten and communicate with page via websock.
